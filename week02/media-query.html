            <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
            <p>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep
                the
                commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if
                they hold out
                faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of
                never-ending
                happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</p>

            <p>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have
                tribulation: but be of
                good cheer; I have overcome the world.</p>
